# History
Well, I looked at bpm4net and thought: Well, that is cool. I want that.

Then I looked at the price and wondered: why isn't it already open source? It is just a few activities and a designed.

And here we go.

Microsoft created a really cool tutorial for creating a custom items:
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/how-to-create-a-custom-activity-designer

along with a blog post:
https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/appfabric/2011/08/14/how-to-create-a-custom-activity-designer-with-windows-workflow-foundation-wf4/

Microsft naming is all about standard and core. .NET Core, EF Core, ASP.NET Core.

So I decided to name this a BPM Core. Yea, original, I know.

# Plan
* Read a lot of sources
* Figure out how to create a parallel gateway (hint> look at referencesource MS has generously provided fro ParallelFor)
* Create native activity
* Create a custom designer
* Create an extension for VS
* bask in the glory of .... noone. Depressing.
